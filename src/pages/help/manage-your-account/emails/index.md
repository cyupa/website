Not receiving our emails? In the past, we’ve found this is usually caused by aggressive security firewalls or spam filters. Try these steps:

1.  Check your email spam folder.
1.  Add **hello@dovetailapp.com** as a contact in your address book.
1.  Whitelist **mail.dovetailapp.com** and **dovetailapp.com**.
1.  Send a test email to **hello@dovetailapp.com** and say hello.
1.  [Resend the confirmation email](/users/confirmation/new) or ask to be re-invited.

If you still can’t receive our emails, you may need to contact your organization’s IT team and ask them to whitelist **mail.dovetailapp.com** and **dovetailapp.com** in the organization’s security firewall and spam filter.
