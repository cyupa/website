To get started with Dovetail, you’ll need to create a project. Projects contain groups of notes, tags, and insights, along with highlights and charts.

Teams, projects, groups, and notes / tags / insights exist in a hierarchy:

1.  Teams have many projects.
1.  Projects have many groups.
1.  Groups have many notes, tags, or insights.

## Projects

In Dovetail, projects can represent many things. For example, a project could contain:

* A set of customer interviews.
* A set of user testing sessions.
* A collection of ongoing user feedback.
* A collection of feedback from other apps.
* A large research project covering many methods.

**Note:** Tags are project-specific. Create a new project when you want to create a new set of tags, or continue using the same project if you’d like to share tags.
